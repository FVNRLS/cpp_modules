Other people' code
I was recently asked why programmers hate working with other people's code. It took me a long time to figure out how to
convey the whole fucked up idea to the average user. I decided to give a little analogy:

Imagine that you were entrusted to finish building a lab on an island for another foreman.
You come to the site, and there's a huge fan (the size of a building), a big balloon, and a room full of mops.
After scratching your head, you disassemble this junk and finish the lab. You turn it in to the scientists,
but five minutes later they come running out screaming, "EARMAL GAS LOSS!!!"

- What the fuck! It's supposed to work! - You scream in despair and call your last foreman:

- Vasya, we've got a toxic gas leak! What's the problem?

- I don't know, everything should be working. Did you change something in the project?

- Not much, the mops...

- The mops were holding up the ceiling!

- What? Excuse me?

- I said the mops were holding up the ceiling. There were gas tanks above them. Very heavy. We had to put mops in the
room underneath.

- You should at least put a note on the door that the mops are for holding the ceiling! We've got poisonous gas leaking
in here! What do we do?

- Turn on the fan. It'll blow the gas off the island.

- I fucking dismantled it right away!

- What for?

- Why did you build a 120-ton fan? Couldn't you have put a box of fucking gas masks in it?

- A case of gas masks is to be found, and I had the fan from the last order.

- Vasya, I took your fan away! We're suffocating in here!

- Then what the fuck are you doing there? Get on a balloon and get the fuck out!
