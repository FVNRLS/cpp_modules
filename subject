The grades of the Form follow the same rules that apply to the Bureaucrat.
Thus, the following exceptions will be thrown if a form grade is out of bounds:
Form::GradeTooHighException and Form::GradeTooLowException.
Same as before, write getters for all attributes and an overload of the insertion («) operator
that prints all the form’s informations.
